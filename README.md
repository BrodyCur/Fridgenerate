# Fridgenerate

You get home after a long day at work. You're starving. You can't think straight. You have all these ingredients, but no idea what to make. Why don't we do the thinking for you? Fridgenerate is an interactive web application that allows users to input ingredients and are provided a list of recipes based on their input.

Technical Aspects

Back-end: built using Python/Django
REST framework: to organize and create custom endpoints for user integration and ingredient data storage
Spoontacular API: a recipe API with data on over 300k recipes.
Front-end: built using REACT.js for ease of creation with components and enhancing UX
Search Functionality: using a dataset of ingredients to cross reference the "Search-by-Ingredient" endpoint of Spoontacular API
Stretch Goal: User Functionality to save recipes and ingredient lists
