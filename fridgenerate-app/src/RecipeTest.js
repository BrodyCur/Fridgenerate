            'ingredients': 'basil leaves , garlic , olive oil , pine nuts , salmon fillets , salt and pepper , white bread',
            'instructions': 'Heat the oven to 400F. Pulse the bread in a food processor to make breadcrumbs. Remove about 1/2 cup of the crumbs and reserve them. Add the pine nuts, garlic, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper to the crumbs in the food processor and pulse. Add the basil and process again. With the motor running, add the olive oil in a slow stream, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl, until the pesto is spreadable. Brush a small baking sheet with oil, put the fillets on it, and season them with salt and pepper. Spread a 1/4-inch layer of the pesto evenly over the top of each fillet. Sprinkle the reserved breadcrumbs over the pesto. Bake until the salmon is cooked -- it should just start to turn opaque, with a trace of bright orange in the middle -- and the topping is lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.'
